### Research Questions:
To what extent do farming/crafting games contribute to environmental education and awareness, and how do players' interactions with in-game mechanics and narratives shape their perceptions and behaviours related to real-world environmental issues?

How do different farming/crafting games implement stamina, health, and time management mechanics, and how do these mechanics affect player experience and immersion within the game world?

What are the advantages and disadvantages of various farming/crafting games, such as Farm Together, Harvest Moon: Light of Hope, and Stardew Valley, in terms of gameplay mechanics, narrative depth, and overall player satisfaction?
